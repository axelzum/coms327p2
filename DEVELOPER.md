#### Part A regrade
Don't know if you're doing a regrade on this part like was done in the past but you should.
I'm guessing what I missed points on and I fixed it in part b.

Added 2*PI to SineWave::Generate function to fix incorrect calculation
Completed SawtoothWave::Generate function was missing before
Added comments to code
Created README and DEVELOPER for project notes and documentation


##### Part A notes
Did not have time to finish all parts and sufficiantly test the code. 
Left out the sawtooth generate function, did not comment code, or do README/DEVELOPER.
